== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this modify my database directly? =

No! This plugin only modifies the content in your editor. You still need to save/update your post for changes to take effect. This gives you full control and the ability to undo changes before saving.

= Will it change my image URLs? =

No, the plugin is designed to safely replace text only in content and titles, not in HTML attributes like image URLs, links, or other attributes.

= Does it work with custom post types? =

Yes! The plugin automatically works with all public post types including custom post types.

= Does it work with the Block Editor (Gutenberg)? =

Yes! The plugin works seamlessly with both the modern Block Editor (Gutenberg) and the Classic Editor.

= Can I undo changes? =

Yes! Since changes are made in the editor before saving, you can simply use your browser's undo function (Ctrl+Z or Cmd+Z) or reload the page without saving to revert changes.

= Is it safe to use? =

Absolutely! The plugin follows WordPress security best practices including capability checks, nonce verification, and proper data sanitization.

= Does it affect performance? =

No, the plugin only loads its lightweight scripts on post editor screens and has minimal impact on performance.

= Can I translate this plugin? =

Yes! The plugin is fully internationalized and ready for translation. You can translate it using Loco Translate or any standard WordPress translation tool.
